1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git directory is created. It's step 0, you have to create a repository before you can put you stuff in there!


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains files that will be added to the repository from the working directory on the next commit. It
s like a spot for undo. 


3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Sometimes a change spans multiple files (moving up/down the stack). You can add each of these files to the staging
area, and commit them together as a logical change.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches might be could for trying out new ideas. Branches keep some changes out of the main branch, until your ready to add them.
